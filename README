Brainfuck Interpreter
=====================

Just another brainfuck interpreter written in C, which supports the 8 standard operators and has virtually unlimited cells due the use of linked lists.

Usage
-----

brainfuck [-f filename] [--safemode] [--help] [--input input]

Without arguments, brainfuck enters in interactive mode, expecting the code from the stdin. To stop writing code, send EOF (usually CTRL-D on Bash) and the program is interpreted.

-f allows to load some file with brainfuck code to be interpreted, instead of writing it on interactive mode.

--safemode checks for unbalanced brackets that could cause the program to create infinite loops. It's disabled by default.

--help shows the help message with explanation of each command

--input gives some default input to your program. Since , (comma) operator reads one single character at time, if you input has egnough characters, it will read the first one and mopve the pointer to the next. If there are no default input, the comma operator will wait some chartacter from stdin.
